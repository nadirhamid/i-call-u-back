I Call U Back
----------------------------------------------
+ simple program for  calling back voicemail at the  transcribed number
  it will use the Google Speech API in transcribing voicemail text from 
  a datasource (currently using MySQL). Once the text has been transcribed it will
 make a callback to the number using a calling API(using Bandwidth)

-- it is very simple, solves a problem of mine :)
